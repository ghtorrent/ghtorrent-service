The idea of providing or retrieving software repository data on-demand as such is not new. The data being provided was
usually limited to the meta-data~\cite{Codebook} or elements of the repository such as files~\cite{Voinea2006Mining}. Similarly to the latter work, lean \ght provides elements of \gh: however, \gh is a \emph{meta repository}  (cf.\ discussion of \ohloh as a meta-repository~\cite{Gruhn2013Security}) and, therefore, its elements are repositories themselves.
