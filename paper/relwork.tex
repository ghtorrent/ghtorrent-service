The idea of providing or retrieving software repository data on-demand as such is not new
and can be seen as related to ``Data as a Service'' or ``Information as a Service''~\cite{Dan2007IaaS}.
The data being provided was usually limited to the meta-data~\cite{Codebook} or elements of the 
repository such as files~\cite{Voinea2006Mining}.
Similarly to the latter work, lean \ght provides elements of \gh.
However, \gh is a \emph{repository of repositories}~\cite{Sowe2007Using} or 
\emph{meta repository}~\cite{Gruhn2013Security} and, therefore, its elements are repositories themselves. 
Meta repositories, including lean \ght, provide for cross-domain analysis~\cite{Sowe2007Using}. 
As opposed to existing meta repositories such as \ohloh or \flossmole~\cite{Howisom2006FLOSSmole}, 
lean \ght provides the researchers with the possibility to select their own object of study rather than 
being forced to analyse the entire collection searching for the proverbial needle.% in a haystack.

Projects hosted \gh or the entire \gh collection have been subject to numerous studies (e.g., \cite{allamanis2013mining,dabbish2012social,heller2011visualizing,%
jiang2013understanding,lee2013git,marlow2013impression,pham2013creating,pham2013building,%
schall2013follow,thung2013network}). 
The \gh mirror and the predecessor of the current work~\cite{gousios2012ghtorrent}, 
has been used in empirical studies~\cite{gousios2014exploratory,squire2014forge,vasilescu2013stackoverflow}.
