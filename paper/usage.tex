\section{Using the service}
\label{sec:usage}
Essentially any study of a restricted collection of \gh repositories can be carried out using the lean \ght offering the advantages of flexibility in selecting the repositories and reproducibility of the results.


\as{Would it make sense to mention the SQL-like interface as a front-end? For
instance, if I'm interested in all projects with at least 10 different committers and at least 100 pull requests, I would use this
SQL-like interface to find the repositories, and then provide them to the \ght DOD webform... Or does this reduce the novelty of the approach / require too much work?}
