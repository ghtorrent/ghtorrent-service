\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We presented a novel feature of \ght that allows users to request \gh data dumps on demand
for any collection of \gh projects (repositories).
Lean \ght offers several advantages, being lightweight and easy to use, fostering replicability
and offering flexibility and independence to researchers interested in mining \gh.
Together with the existing \ght infrastructure, the new lean data-on-demand service lowers 
the ``barrier for entry'' for \gh miners to a minimum.
We hope this will encourage researchers to intensify their efforts to mine \gh data, as well as
serve as inspiration for others willing to share software engineering datasets (the implementations
of both \ght and lean \ght are publicly available).
