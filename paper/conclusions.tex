\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We presented a novel feature of \ght that allows users to request \gh data dumps on demand
for any collection of \gh projects (repositories).
Lean \ght offers several advantages, being lightweight and easy to use, fostering replicability
and offering flexibility and independence to researchers interested in mining \gh.
Together with the existing \ght infrastructure, the new lean data-on-demand service lowers 
the ``barrier for entry'' for \gh miners to a minimum.
We hope this will encourage researchers to intensify their efforts to mine \gh data, as well as
serve as inspiration for others willing to share software engineering datasets (the implementations
of both \ght and lean \ght are publicly available).

%In recent years, \gh has become the largest code host in the world, with more than 5M developers
%collaborating across 10M repositories.
%Numerous popular open source projects (such as Ruby on Rails, Homebrew, Bootstrap, Django or JQuery)
%have chosen \gh as their host and have migrated their code base to it.
%\gh offers a tremendous research potential.
%For instance, it is a flagship for current open source development, a place for developers to showcase
%their expertise to peers or potential recruiters, and the platform where social coding features or
%pull requests emerged.
%However, \gh data is, to date, largely underexplored.
%To facilitate studies of \gh, we have created \ght, a scalable, queriable, offline mirror of the data offered
%through the \gh REST API.
%In this paper we present a novel feature of \ght designed to offer customisable data dumps on demand.
%The new \ght data-on-demand service offers users the possibility to request via a web form
%up-to-date \ght data dumps for any collection of \gh repositories.
%We hope that by offering customisable \ght data dumps we will not only lower the ``barrier for entry''
%even further for researchers interested in mining \gh data (thus encourage researchers to intensify their
%mining efforts), but also enhance the replicability of \gh studies (since a snapshot of the data on which
%the results were obtained can now easily accompany each study).
