\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

Designing and implementing a robust and scalable lean \ght was a serious endeavour.
Still, in its current implementation lean \ght has a number of limitations.
First, dumps contain only the first level dependencies (e.g., contributors to a repository, but not followers of these
contributors).
Second, depending on the size of the request and the load on \ght servers at that time, creating the dumps
can be a lengthy process, potentially requiring several hours to complete.
Third, no recovery actions in case of errors are currently implemented, potentially leading to incomplete dumps,
e.g., if \gh fails to answer an API request.
Researchers using lean \ght data are advised to check the integrity of the data dumps themselves and, 
in case of corruption, resubmit the request to lean \ght for a fresh data dump.
Finally, to limit the load on \ght servers, requests to lean \ght should not exceed 1000 repositories.
